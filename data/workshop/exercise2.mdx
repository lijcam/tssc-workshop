In this lab we'll sign a container image with Tekton Chains.

## Lab environment
Navigate to your project and find the `tssc-terminal` container. Create a terminal session within OpenShift:

<Zoom>
![terminal](/static/images/terminal.png)
</Zoom>

Inside the terminal session login to quay.io:
```
podman login --authfile=auth.json quay.io
```
Copy the example image into your own quay.io account:
```
podman pull quay.io/smileyfritz/chat-client:latest
podman tag quay.io/smileyfritz/chat-client:latest quay.io/<your-quay-handle>/chat-client:latest
```
Create a new application from the new image:
```
oc new-app quay.io/<your-quay-handle>/chat-client:latest
```

## Create the pipeline secrets
Create a secret for the registry configuration:
```
oc create secret generic regcred --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=auth.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```
Navigate to ACS and select `Platform configuration -> Integrations`. Scroll to the bottom of the page and find `StackRox API tokens`.

<Zoom>
![api1](/static/images/exercise2/api1.png)
</Zoom>

Create a token for your username. For the role, select `Continuous Integration`.

<Zoom>
![api2](/static/images/exercise2/api2.png)
</Zoom>

Once complete select `Generate`.

Copy the API token and create a new secret:
```
oc create secret generic acstoken --from-literal=token=<your-token-here>
```

## Create the pipeline
Change into the `pipeline` directory and inspect the resources:
```
cd pipeline
ls -l
```
There's a few changes that you need to make to this pipeline configuration. Firstly, open the `pipeline-run-with-scan.yaml` file with one of the available text editors (`vim` or `nano`):
```
vim pipeline-run-with-scan.yaml 
```
Update the following parameters:

* `image-name`: Update this to reflect your quay.io handle
* `acs-scan-api`: Update this to the route for ACS, e.g. central-acs-central.apps.vlme6l1rt1709976be.australiasoutheast.aroapp.io

Once you've made these changes, create all the resources in the `pipeline` directory:
```
oc create -f .
```

## Run the pipeline
Let's set a few permissions and run the pipeline:
```
oc adm policy add-role-to-user isview -z pipeline-svc --role-namespace=<your-project> -n <your-project>
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipeline-svc
```
Now start the pipeline:
```
oc create -f pipeline-run-with-scan.yaml
```
You should now be able to navigate to `Pipeline` and see the pipeline running:

<Zoom>
![pipeline1](/static/images/exercise2/pipeline1.png)
</Zoom>

## Verify the container signatures and tlog entry
Login to quay.io and verify that there is a small shield next to the `latest` tag. Hovering over the tag should show "this tag has been signed by cosign".

<Zoom>
![quay1](/static/images/exercise2/quay1.png)
</Zoom>

Navigate back to the terminal window and check that you can verify the container image with `cosign`:
```
cosign verify --key k8s://openshift-pipelines/signing-secrets quay.io/<your-quay-handle>/chat-client:latest
```
If everything ran successfully, you should see that the cosign claims are valid:
```
Verification for quay.io/smileyfritz/chat-client:latest --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The claims were present in the transparency log
  - The signatures were integrated into the transparency log when the certificate was valid
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key

[{"critical":{"identity":{"docker-reference":"quay.io/smileyfritz/chat-client"},"image":{"docker-manifest-digest":"sha256:0be008b5cdaafa8b0b600f89f7524e2126c18e92f7c5b6a73aadccd2af413581"},"type":"cosign container image signature"},"optional":null}]
```
You can also verify that an attestation has also been created and signed. Firstly, we need the digest of the container image that was just created:
```
crane digest quay.io/<your-quay-handle>/chat-client:latest
sha256:a1a783df5746d9eaa75decb3feb75c4fec8d4b26ccac590642c1daee3ac78fcc
```
Now you can perform a search using the `rekor-cli` for this digest:
```
rekor-cli search --sha=sha256:a1a783df5746d9eaa75decb3feb75c4fec8d4b26ccac590642c1daee3ac78fcc
Found matching entries (listed by UUID):

```
Finally, grab the attestation that was created by Tekton Chains and take a look at the output:
```
rekor-cli get --uuid 24296fb24b8ad77a49c0d1ee06c740a6ecb6999b50d8a2133ae305d76b4f71d8a156487e54240f9d --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq
